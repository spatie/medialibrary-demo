## Media Library Demo

This repo contains a Laravel application in which Laravel Media Library is installed. 

Routes have been added to demonstrate the most important features of the medialibrary.

You can make use of these artisan commands:

-  `php artisan visit`: visit one of the demo routes
- `php artisan reset-demo`: remove all media and reset the database to the initial state
